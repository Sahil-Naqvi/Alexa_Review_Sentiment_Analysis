# Alexa_Review_Sentiment_Analysis

Amazon is an American multinational corporation that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence products. But it is mainly known for its e-commerce platform which is one of the biggest online shopping platforms today. There are so many customers buying products from Amazon that today Amazon earns an average of $ 638.1 million per day. So having such a large customer base, it will turn out to be an amazing data science project if we can analyse the sentiments of Amazon Alexa reviews. So, in this project, I will walk you through the task of Amazon Alexa Reviews Sentiment Analysis with Python.

**Amazon Alexa Reviews Sentiment Analysis with Python**

The dataset I’m using for the task of Amazon Alexa reviews sentiment analysis was downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset contains the product reviews of over 3150 customers who have purchased Alexa from Amazon. I also did some pre-processing and gained valuable insights out of my dataset which directly help me in building my model more  accurate and reliable.

According to the figure above, more than half of people rated Alexa they bought from Amazon with 5 stars, which is good. 

Mean Absolute Error of the Random Forest Model that we build was found out to be **0.05** which is extremely good as per my opinion. And the accuracy score of this model was found out to be **94%**. Similarly, the F1 score is somewhere around **96**.
